# Red Soviz

## Goal

Baseball analysts can use MLB Data API to analyze performance of baseball players. Normally, when we go to MLB website, we couldn't quickly compare performance because it is just tabular data. Therefore, the project is to faciliate analytics process for professional analysts, especially for Red Sox.
